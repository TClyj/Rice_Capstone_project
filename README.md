The zip file C_application_demo contains my block design for the ARTY S7-50, which is the board file I use in Vivado. You can just open it with .xpr file inside in Vivado 2024.1

freertos_test_wrapper.xsa is the hardware output of design_1. You can use it in Vitis to run the sample Hello World program provided by AMD.
